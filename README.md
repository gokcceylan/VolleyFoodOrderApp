This app uses RecyclerView for Activites and CardView for listed items. Activites have Linear Layout to showcase cards as a list.
 Constraint Layout is preferred to have the widgets on each card. Floating Action Button is used to access the cart.
 Collapsing search bar is used for searching. Volley is the preferred RESTful here. JSONObect is used to parse JSON responses of the web service.
 Hostinger is the web service provider. 2 Adapters and 2 classes are used for handling CardView actions.
